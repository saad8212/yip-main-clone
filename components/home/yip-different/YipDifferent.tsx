          A unique feature of Your Internet Provider is its ability to compute
          and present the required speed options based on the user's input about
          the number and kind of devices. The user can choose the bundles they
          require because of this functionality.

          This phase displays three internet speed suggestions based on the
          user's chosen devices. The minimum option shows the speed if the usage
          is very basic, i.e., personal use on a phone or laptop (less video
          streaming). The second option (Average) is for customers who stream
          and download videos frequently. For those that require high-speed for
          gaming, live streaming, etc., the third option (Maximum) is available.
