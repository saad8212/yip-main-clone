            The United States is one of the world's largest consumers and
            providers of Internet services, with a robust and rapidly evolving
            market. The country has a highly developed internet services
            infrastructure, including wired and wireless technologies. According
            to recent studies, over 90% of the US population has access to
            broadband services, with an average download speed of around 140
            Mbps.
          </p>
          <p className="para__primary">
            Multiple services are available, including DSL, cable, fiber-optic,
            and satellite internet. Each type of service has advantages and
            limitations, and the availability and quality of these services can
            vary by region.
          </p>
          <p className="para__primary">
            The demand for high-speed services has been steadily increasing,
            especially with the rise of remote work and online learning. As a
            result, service providers are continuously working to improve their
            services and expand their coverage to meet the growing demand. With
            so many options available, consumers in the US have the flexibility
            to choose the service provider and plan that best fits their needs
            and budget.
